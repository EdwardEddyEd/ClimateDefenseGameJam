Discussion Stuff:
	Should we have a floating title?

Implementation List:
	Tower
		Head = damage
		Body = rate of fire
		Feet = range

	Headline (Event.js):
		Debuffs (bad policies or climate change disaster)
		Buffs?  (good policies)
		Give visual feedback on it

TODO:
	Allow player to see range of tower before placing it down
	Allow player to select a new tower or cancel tower selection from inventory.
